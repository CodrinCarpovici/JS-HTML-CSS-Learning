<!--HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements 
    can contain other elements).
    All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.-->

<!--Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
    These elements are called empty elements. 
    Empty elements do not have an end tag!-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
<!--The br tag defines a line break. 
    It is an empty element without a closing tag-->

</body>
</html>

<!--HTML is not case sensitive.
That means <P> is the same as <p>-->
