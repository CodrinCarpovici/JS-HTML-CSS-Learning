<!--
When drawImage is given nine arguments, it can be used to draw only
a fragment of an image. The second through fifth arguments indicate
the rectangle (x, y, width, and height) in the source image that should
be copied, and the sixth to ninth arguments give the rectangle (on the
canvas) into which it should be copied.
This can be used to pack multiple sprites (image elements) into a
single image file and then draw only the part you need. 
By alternating which pose we draw, we can show an animation that
looks like a walking character.
To animate a picture on a canvas, the clearRect method is useful.
It resembles fillRect, but instead of coloring the rectangle, it makes it
transparent, removing the previously drawn pixels.
