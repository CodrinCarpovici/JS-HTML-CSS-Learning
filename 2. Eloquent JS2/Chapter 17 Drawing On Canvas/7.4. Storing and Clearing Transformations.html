<!--
The save and restore methods on the 2D canvas context do this
transformation management. They conceptually keep a stack of transformation 
states. When you call save, the current state is pushed onto
the stack, and when you call restore, the state on top of the stack is
taken off and used as the context’s current transformation. You can
also call resetTransform to fully reset the transformation.

<canvas width="600" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    function branch(length, angle, scale) {
        cx.fillRect(0, 0, 1, length);
        if (length < 8) return;
        cx.save();
        cx.translate(0, length);
        cx.rotate(-angle);
        branch(length * scale, angle, scale);
        cx.rotate(2 * angle);
        branch(length * scale, angle, scale);
        cx.restore();
    }
    cx.translate(300, 0);
    branch(60, 0.5, 0.8);
</script>

<!--
If the calls to save and restore were not there, the second recursive
call to branch would end up with the position and rotation created
by the first call. It wouldn’t be connected to the current branch but
rather to the innermost, rightmost branch drawn by the first call. The
resulting shape might also be interesting, but it is definitely not a tree.
