<!--
Canvas graphics can be drawn onto a <canvas> element. You can give
such an element width and height attributes to determine its size in
pixels.
A new canvas is empty, meaning it is entirely transparent and thus
shows up as empty space in the document.
The <canvas> tag is intended to allow different styles of drawing.
To get access to an actual drawing interface, we first need to create 
a context, an object whose methods provide the drawing interface. There 
are currently two widely supported drawing styles: "2d"
for two-dimensional graphics and "webgl" for three-dimensional graphics 
through the OpenGL interface.
You create a context with the getContext method on the <canvas>
DOM element.

<script>
    let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
    let context = canvas.getContext("2d");
    context.fillStyle = "red";
    context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 50)
