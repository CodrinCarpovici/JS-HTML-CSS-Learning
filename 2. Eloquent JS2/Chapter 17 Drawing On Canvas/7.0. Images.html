<!--
In computer graphics, a distinction is often made between vector graphics 
and bitmap graphics. The first is what we have been doing so far
in this chapter—specifying a picture by giving a logical description of
shapes. Bitmap graphics, on the other hand, don’t specify actual shapes
but rather work with pixel data (rasters of colored dots).
The drawImage method allows us to draw pixel data onto a canvas.
This pixel data can originate from an <img> element or from another
canvas. The following example creates a detached <img> element and
loads an image file into it. But it cannot immediately start drawing
from this picture because the browser may not have loaded it yet. To
deal with this, we register a "load" event handler and do the drawing
after the image has loaded.

<canvas width="1000" height="1000"></canvas>
<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    let img = document.createElement("img");
    img.src = "img/hat.jpg";
    img.addEventListener("load", () => {
        for (let x = 10; x < 200; x += 30) {
            cx.drawImage(img, x, 10);
        }
    });
</script>
