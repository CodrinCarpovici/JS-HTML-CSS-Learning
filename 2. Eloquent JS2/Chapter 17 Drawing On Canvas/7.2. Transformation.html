<!--
But what if we want our character to walk to the left instead of to the
right? We could draw another set of sprites, of course. But we can also
instruct the canvas to draw the picture the other way round.
Calling the scale method will cause anything drawn after it to be
scaled. This method takes two parameters, one to set a horizontal scale
and one to set a vertical scale.
-->

<canvas></canvas>
<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    cx.scale(3, .5);
    cx.beginPath();
    cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
    cx.lineWidth = 3;
    cx.stroke();
</script>

<!--
to turn a picture around, we can’t simply add cx.scale(-1, 1) before the 
call to drawImage because that would move our picture outside
of the canvas, where it won’t be visible.
-->

<!--
To flip a picture around the vertical line at a given x position, we can
do the following:

-->

<script>
    function flipHorizontally(context, around) {
        context.translate(around, 0);
        context.scale(-1, 1);
        context.translate(-around, 0);
    }
</script>

<!--
We move the y-axis to where we want our mirror to be, apply the
mirroring, and finally move the y-axis back to its proper place in the
mirrored universe.
