<p>Normal HTML here.</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="red" />
    <rect x="120" y="5" width="90" height="90" stroke="blue" fill="none" />
</svg>

<!--
The xmlns attribute changes an element (and its children) to a different 
XML namespace. This namespace, identified by a URL, specifies
the dialect that we are currently speaking. The <circle> and <rect>
tags, which do not exist in HTML, do have a meaning in SVGâ€”they
draw shapes using the style and position specified by their attributes.

These tags create DOM elements, just like HTML tags, that scripts
can interact with. For example, this changes the <circle> element to
be colored cyan instead:
-->

<script>
    let circle = document.querySelector("circle");
    circle.setAttribute("fill", "cyan");
</script>
