<!--
In the canvas interface, a shape can be filled, meaning its area is given
a certain color or pattern, or it can be stroked, which means a line is
drawn along its edge. The same terminology is used by SVG.
-->

<canvas></canvas>
<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    cx.strokeStyle = "blue";
    cx.strokeRect(5, 5, 50, 50);
    cx.lineWidth = 5;
    cx.strokeRect(135, 5, 50, 50);
</script>

<!--
This code draws two blue squares, using a thicker line for the second
one.  
When no width or height attribute is specified, as in the example,
a canvas element gets a default width of 300 pixels and height of 150
pixels.
