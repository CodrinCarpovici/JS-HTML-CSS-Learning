The arc method is a way to draw a line that curves along the edge
of a circle. It takes a pair of coordinates for the arc’s center, a radius,
and then a start angle and end angle.
Those last two parameters make it possible to draw only part of the
circle. The angles are measured in radians, not degrees. This means a
full circle has an angle of 2π, or 2 * Math.PI, which is about 6.28. The
angle starts counting at the point to the right of the circle’s center and
goes clockwise from there. You can use a start of 0 and an end bigger
than 2π (say, 7) to draw a full circle.

<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    cx.beginPath();
    //center=(50, 50) radius=40 angle=0 to 7
    cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
    //center=(150, 50)  radius=40 angle=0 to PI/2
    cx.arc(150, 50, 40, 0, 0.5 * Math.PI);
    cx.stroke();
</script>

The resulting picture contains a line from the right of the full circle
(first call to arc) to the right of the quarter-circle (second call). Like
other path-drawing methods, a line drawn with arc is connected to the
previous path segment. You can call moveTo or start a new path to avoid
this.
