<!--
A path is a sequence of lines. The 2D canvas interface takes a peculiar
approach to describing such a path. It is done entirely through side
effects. Paths are not values that can be stored and passed around.
Instead, if you want to do something with a path, you make a sequence
of method calls to describe its shape.

<canvas></canvas>
<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    cx.beginPath();
    for (let y = 10; y < 100; y +=10) {
        cx.moveTo(10, y);
        cx.lineTo(90, y);
    }
    cx.stroke();
</script>

<!--
This example creates a path with a number of horizontal line segments and 
then strokes it using the stroke method. Each segment
created with lineTo starts at the pathâ€™s current position. That position
is usually the end of the last segment, unless moveTo was called. In that
case, the next segment would start at the position passed to moveTo.
