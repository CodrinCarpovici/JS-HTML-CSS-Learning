Browsers give us several ways to display graphics. The simplest way is
to use styles to position and color regular DOM elements.
But we’d be using the DOM for something that it wasn’t originally
designed for.
There are two alternatives. The first is DOM-based but utilizes Scalable 
Vector Graphics (SVG), rather than HTML. Think of SVG as a
document-markup dialect that focuses on shapes rather than text.
The second alternative is called a canvas. A canvas is a single DOM
element that encapsulates a picture. It provides a programming interface 
for drawing shapes onto the space taken up by the node.
