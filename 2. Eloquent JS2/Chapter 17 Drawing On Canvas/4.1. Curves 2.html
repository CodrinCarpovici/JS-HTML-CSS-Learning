<!--
The bezierCurveTo method draws a similar kind of curve. Instead
of a single control point, this one has two—one for each of the line’s
endpoints.

<script>
    let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
    cx.beginPath();
    cx.moveTo(10,90);
    // control=(10,10) control2=(90,10) goal=(50,90)
    cx.bezierCurveTo(10, 10, 90, 10, 50, 90);
    cx.lineTo(90, 10);
    cx.lineTo(10, 10);
    cx.closePath();
    cx.stroke();
</script>

<!--
The two control points specify the direction at both ends of the curve.
The farther they are away from their corresponding point, the more the
curve will “bulge” in that direction.
