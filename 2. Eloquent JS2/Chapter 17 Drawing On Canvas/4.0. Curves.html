<!--
The quadraticCurveTo method draws a curve to a given point. To
determine the curvature of the line, the method is given a control point
as well as a destination point. Imagine this control point as attracting
the line, giving it its curve. The line wonâ€™t go through the control
point, but its direction at the start and end points will be such that
a straight line in that direction would point toward the control point.

<!--
We draw a quadratic curve from the left to the right, with (60,10)
as control point, and then draw two line segments going through that
control point and back to the start of the line.
