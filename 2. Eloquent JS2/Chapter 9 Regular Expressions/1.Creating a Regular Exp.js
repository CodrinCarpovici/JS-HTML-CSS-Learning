/*
Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data. They
form a small, separate language that is part of JavaScript and many
other languages and systems.

A regular expression is a type of object. It can be either constructed
with the RegExp constructor or written as a literal value by enclosing a
pattern in forward slash (/) characters.
*/

let re1 = new RegExp("abc");
let re2 = /abc/;

/*
Both of those regular expression objects represent the same pattern:
an a character followed by a b followed by a c.
*/
/*
When using the RegExp constructor, the pattern is written as a normal
string, so the usual rules apply for backslashes.
The second notation, where the pattern appears between slash characters, 
treats backslashes somewhat differently. First, since a forward
slash ends the pattern, we need to put a backslash before any forward
slash that we want to be part of the pattern. In addition, backslashes
that arenâ€™t part of special character codes (like \n) will be preserved,
rather than ignored as they are in strings, and change the meaning of
the pattern. Some characters, such as question marks and plus signs,
have special meanings in regular expressions and must be preceded by
a backslash if they are meant to represent the character itself.
