<!--
There are specific event types fired by touch interaction. When a
finger starts touching the screen, you get a "touchstart" event. When
it is moved while touching, "touchmove" events fire. Finally, when it
stops touching the screen, you’ll see a "touchend" event.
Because many touchscreens can detect multiple fingers at the same
time, these events don’t have a single set of coordinates associated with
them. Rather, their event objects have a touches property, which holds
an array-like object of points, each of which has its own clientX, clientY,
pageX, and pageY properties.
You could do something like this to show red circles around every
touching finger:
-->

<style>
    dot {
        position: absolute;
        display: block;
        border: 2px solid red;
        border-radius: 50px;
        height: 100px;
        width: 100px;
    }
</style>
<p>Touch this page</p>
<script>
    function update(event) {
        for (let dot; dot = document.querySelector("dot");) {
            dot.remove();
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < event.touches.length; i++) {
            let { pageX, pageY } = event.touches[i];
            let dot = document.createElement("dot");
            dot.style.left = (pageX - 50) + "px";
            dot.style.top = (pageY - 50) + "px";
            document.body.appendChild(dot);
        }
    }
    window.addEventListener("touchstart", update);
    window.addEventListener("touchmove", update);
    window.addEventListener("touchend", update);
</script>
