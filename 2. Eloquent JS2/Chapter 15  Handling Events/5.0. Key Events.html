<!--
When a key on the keyboard is pressed, your browser fires a "keydown"
event. When it is released, you get a "keyup" event.
-->

<p> This page turns violet when you hold the V key.</p>
<script>
    window.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
       if(event.key == "v") {
           document.body.style.background = "violet";
       }
    });
    window.addEventListener("keyup", event => {
        if(event.key == "v") {
            document.body.style.background = "";
        }
    });
</script>

<!--
Despite its name, "keydown" fires not only when the key is physically
pushed down. When a key is pressed and held, the event fires again
every time the key repeats. Sometimes you have to be careful about this.
For example, if you add a button to the DOM when a key is pressed
and remove it again when the key is released, you might accidentally
add hundreds of buttons when the key is held down longer.
