<!--
Every time the mouse pointer moves, a "mousemove" event is fired. This
event can be used to track the position of the mouse. A common situation 
in which this is useful is when implementing some form of mousedragging 
functionality.
As an example, the following program displays a bar and sets up
event handlers so that dragging to the left or right on this bar makes it
narrower or wider:
-->

<p>Drag the bar to change its width:</p>
<div style="background: orange; width:60px; height: 20px">
</div>

<script>
    let lastX; //Tracks the last observed mouse X position
    let bar = document.querySelector("div");
    bar.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
        if(event.button == 0) {
            lastX = event.clientX;
            window.addEventListener("mousemove", moved);
            event. preventDefault(); // Prevent selection
        }
    });

    function moved(event) {
        if (event.buttons == 0) {
            window.removeEventListener("mousemove", moved);
        } else {
            let dist = event.clientX - lastX;
            let newWidth = Math.max(10, bar.offsetWidth + dist);
            bar.style.width = newWidth + "px";
            lastX = event.clientX;
        }
    }
</script>

<!--
Note that the "mousemove" handler is registered on the whole window.
Even if the mouse goes outside of the bar during resizing, as long as
the button is held we still want to update its size.
We must stop resizing the bar when the mouse button is released.
For that, we can use the buttons property (note the plural), which tells
us about the buttons that are currently held down. When this is zero,
no buttons are down. When buttons are held, its value is the sum
of the codes for those buttons—the left button has code 1, the right
button 2, and the middle one 4. With the left and right buttons held,
for example, the value of buttons will be 3.
Note that the order of these codes is different from the one used
by button, where the middle button came before the right one. As
mentioned, consistency isn’t really a strong point of the browser’s 
programming interface.
