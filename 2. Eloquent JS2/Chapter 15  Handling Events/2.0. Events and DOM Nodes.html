<!--
Each browser event handler is registered in a context. In the previous
example we called addEventListener on the window object to register a
handler for the whole window. Such a method can also be found on
DOM elements and some other types of objects. Event listeners are
called only when the event happens in the context of the object they
are registered on.
-->

<button>Click me</button>
<p>No handler here</p>
<script>
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Button clicked.");
    });
</script>
