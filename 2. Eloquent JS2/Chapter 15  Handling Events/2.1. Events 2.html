<!--
That example attaches a handler to the button node. Clicks on the
button cause that handler to run, but clicks on the rest of the document
do not.
Giving a node an onclick attribute has a similar effect. This works for
most types of events—you can attach a handler through the attribute
whose name is the event name with on in front of it.
But a node can have only one onclick attribute, so you can register
only one handler per node that way. The addEventListener method
allows you to add any number of handlers so that it is safe to add
handlers even if there is already another handler on the element.
The removeEventListener method, called with arguments similar to
addEventListener, removes a handler.

<button>Act-once button</button>
<script>
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    function once() {
        console.log("Done.");
        button.removeEventListener("click", once);
    }
    button.addEventListener("click", once);
</script>

<!--
The function given to removeEventListener has to be the same function 
value that was given to addEventListener. So, to unregister a handler, 
you’ll want to give the function a name (once, in the example) to
be able to pass the same function value to both methods.
