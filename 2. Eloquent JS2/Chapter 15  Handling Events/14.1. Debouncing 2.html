<!--
We can use a slightly different pattern if we want to space responses
so that theyâ€™re separated by at least a certain length of time but want
to fire them during a series of events, not just afterward. For example,
we might want to respond to "mousemove" events by showing the current
coordinates of the mouse but only every 250 milliseconds.

    let scheduled = null;
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", event => {
        if (!scheduled) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                document.body.textContent = 
                    `Mouse at ${scheduled.pageX}, ${scheduled.pageY}`;
                scheduled = null;
            }, 250);
        }
        scheduled = event;
    });
