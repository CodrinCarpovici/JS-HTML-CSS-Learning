Imagine an interface where the only way to find out whether a key on
the keyboard is being pressed is to read the current state of that key.
To be able to react to keypresses, you would have to constantly read
the key’s state so that you’d catch it before it’s released again. It would
be dangerous to perform other time-intensive computations since you
might miss a keypress.
Some primitive machines do handle input like that. A step up from
this would be for the hardware or operating system to notice the keypress and put it in a queue. A program can then periodically check the
queue for new events and react to what it finds there.
Of course, it has to remember to look at the queue, and to do it
often, because any time between the key being pressed and the program
noticing the event will cause the software to feel unresponsive. This
approach is called polling. Most programmers prefer to avoid it.
A better mechanism is for the system to actively notify our code when
an event occurs. Browsers do this by allowing us to register functions
as handlers for specific events.
