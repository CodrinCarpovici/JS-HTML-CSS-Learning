<!--
For most event types, handlers registered on nodes with children will
also receive events that happen in the children. If a button inside a
paragraph is clicked, event handlers on the paragraph will also see the
click event.
But if both the paragraph and the button have a handler, the more
specific handler—the one on the button—gets to go first. The event is
said to propagate outward, from the node where it happened to that
node’s parent node and on to the root of the document. Finally, after
all handlers registered on a specific node have had their turn, handlers
registered on the whole window get a chance to respond to the event.
At any point, an event handler can call the stopPropagation method
on the event object to prevent handlers further up from receiving the
event. This can be useful when, for example, you have a button inside
another clickable element and you don’t want clicks on the button to
activate the outer element’s click behavior.
The following example registers "mousedown" handlers on both a button 
and the paragraph around it. When clicked with the right mouse
button, the handler for the button calls stopPropagation, which will
prevent the handler on the paragraph from running. When the button
is clicked with another mouse button, both handlers will run.

<p>A paragraph with a <button>button</button>.</p>

<script>
    let para = document.querySelector("p");
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    para.addEventListener("mousedown", () => {
        console.log("Handler for paragraph.");
    });
    button.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
        console.log("Handler for button.");
        if (event.button == 2) event.stopPropagation();
    });
</script>
