HTML
HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the document
format used for web pages. An HTML document contains text, as well
as tags that give structure to the text, describing things such as links,
paragraphs, and headings.
A short HTML document might look like this:
-->

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>My home page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My home page</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.</p>
<p>I also wrote a book! Read it
<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--
The tags, wrapped in angle brackets (< and >, the symbols for less
than and greater than), provide information about the structure of the
document. The other text is just plain text.
The document starts with <!doctype html>, which tells the browser
to interpret the page as modern HTML, as opposed to various dialects
351
that were in use in the past.
HTML documents have a head and a body. The head contains information about 
the document, and the body contains the document
itself. In this case, the head declares that the title of this document
is “My home page” and that it uses the UTF-8 encoding, which is a
way to encode Unicode text as binary data. The document’s body
contains a heading (<h1>, meaning “heading 1”—<h2> to <h6> produce
subheadings) and two paragraphs (<p>).
Tags come in several forms. An element, such as the body, a paragraph, or 
a link, is started by an opening tag like <p> and ended by
a closing tag like </p>. Some opening tags, such as the one for the
link (<a>), contain extra information in the form of name="value" pairs.
These are called attributes. In this case, the destination of the link is 
indicated with href="http://eloquentjavascript.net", where href stands
for “hypertext reference”.
Some kinds of tags do not enclose anything and thus do not need to
be closed. The metadata tag <meta charset="utf-8"> is an example of
this.
To be able to include angle brackets in the text of a document, even
though they have a special meaning in HTML, yet another form of
special notation has to be introduced. A plain opening angle bracket is
written as &lt; (“less than”), and a closing bracket is written as &gt;
(“greater than”). In HTML, an ampersand (&) character followed by a
name or character code and a semicolon (;) is called an entity and will
be replaced by the character it encodes.
This is analogous to the way backslashes are used in JavaScript
strings. Since this mechanism gives ampersand characters a special
meaning, too, they need to be escaped as &amp;. Inside attribute values, 
which are wrapped in double quotes, &quot; can be used to insert
an actual quote character.
HTML is parsed in a remarkably error-tolerant way. When tags that
should be there are missing, the browser reconstructs them. The way
in which this is done has been standardized, and you can rely on all
modern browsers to do it in the same way.
