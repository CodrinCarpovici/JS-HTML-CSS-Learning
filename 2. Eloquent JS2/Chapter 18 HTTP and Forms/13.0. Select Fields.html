<!--
Select fields are conceptually similar to radio buttons—they also allow
the user to choose from a set of options. But where a radio button
puts the layout of the options under our control, the appearance of a
<select> tag is determined by the browser.

Select fields also have a variant that is more akin to a list of checkboxes, 
rather than radio boxes. When given the multiple attribute, a
<select> tag will allow the user to select any number of options, rather
than just a single option. This will, in most browsers, show up differently 
than a normal select field, which is typically drawn as a drop-down
control that shows the options only when you open it.

The <option> tags for a <select> field can be accessed as an array-like
object through the field’s options property. Each option has a property 
called selected, which indicates whether that option is currently
selected. The property can also be written to select or deselect an
option.

<select multiple>
    <option value="1">0001</option>
    <option value="2">0010</option>
    <option value="4">0100</option>
    <option value="8">1000</option>
</select> = <span id="output">0</span>

<script>
    let select = document.querySelector("select");
    let output = document.querySelector("#output");
    select.addEventListener("change", () => {
        let number = 0;
        for (let option of Array.from(select.options)) {
            if (option.selected) {
                number += Number(option.value);
            }
        }
        output.textContent = number;
    });
</script>
