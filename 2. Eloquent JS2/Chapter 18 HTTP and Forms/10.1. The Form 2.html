<!--
Intercepting "submit" events in JavaScript has various uses. We can
write code to verify that the values the user entered make sense and
immediately show an error message instead of submitting the form. Or
we can disable the regular way of submitting the form entirely, as in the
example, and have our program handle the input, possibly using fetch
to send it to a server without reloading the page.
