<!--
As we saw in the example, a browser will make a request when we enter
a URL in its address bar. When the resulting HTML page references
other files, such as images and JavaScript files, those are also retrieved.
A moderately complicated website can easily include anywhere from
10 to 200 resources. To be able to fetch those quickly, browsers will
make several GET requests simultaneously, rather than waiting for the
responses one at a time.
HTML pages may include forms, which allow the user to fill out
information and send it to the server. This is an example of a form:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Form</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form method="GET" action="example/message.html">
        <p>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></p>
        <p>Message:<br><textarea name="message"></textarea></p>
        <p><button type="submit">Send</button></p>
    </form>

<!--
This code describes a form with two fields: a small one asking for a
name and a larger one to write a message in. When you click the Send
button, the form is submitted, meaning that the content of its field is
packed into an HTTP request and the browser navigates to the result
of that request.
When the <form> element’s method attribute is GET (or is omitted),
the information in the form is added to the end of the action URL as
a query string. The browser might make a request to this URL:

GET /example/message.html?name=Jean&message=Yes%3F HTTP/1.1

The question mark indicates the end of the path part of the URL
and the start of the query. It is followed by pairs of names and values,
corresponding to the name attribute on the form field elements and the
content of those elements, respectively. An ampersand character (&) is
used to separate the pairs.
The actual message encoded in the URL is “Yes?”, but the question
mark is replaced by a strange code. Some characters in query strings
must be escaped. The question mark, represented as %3F, is one of
those. There seems to be an unwritten rule that every format needs
its own way of escaping characters. This one, called URL encoding,
uses a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal (base 16) digits that
encode the character code. In this case, 3F, which is 63 in decimal
notation, is the code of a question mark character. JavaScript provides
the encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent functions to encode and
decode this format.
-->
    <script>
        console.log(encodeURIComponent("Yes?"));
        //->Yes%3F
        console.log(decodeURIComponent("Yes%3F"));
        //->Yes?
    </script>

<!--
If we change the method attribute of the HTML form in the example
we saw earlier to POST, the HTTP request made to submit the form
will use the POST method and put the query string in the body of the
request, rather than adding it to the URL.

POST /example/message.html HTTP/1.1
Content-length: 24
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
name=Jean&message=Yes%3F

GET requests should be used for requests that do not have side effects
but simply ask for information. Requests that change something on the
server, for example creating a new account or posting a message, should
be expressed with other methods, such as POST. Client-side software
such as a browser knows that it shouldn’t blindly make POST requests
but will often implicitly make GET requests—for example to prefetch a
resource it believes the user will soon need
-->
