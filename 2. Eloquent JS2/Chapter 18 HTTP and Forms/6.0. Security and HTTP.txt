Data traveling over the Internet tends to follow a long, dangerous road.
To get to its destination, it must hop through anything from coffee shop
Wi-Fi hotspots to networks controlled by various companies and states.
At any point along its route it may be inspected or even modified.
If it is important that something remain secret, such as the password
to your email account, or that it arrive at its destination unmodified,
such as the account number you transfer money to via your bankâ€™s
website, plain HTTP is not good enough.
The secure HTTP protocol, used for URLs starting with https://,
wraps HTTP traffic in a way that makes it harder to read and tamper
with. Before exchanging data, the client verifies that the server is who it
claims to be by asking it to prove that it has a cryptographic certificate
issued by a certificate authority that the browser recognizes. Next,
all data going over the connection is encrypted in a way that should
prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
Thus, when it works right, HTTPS prevents other people from impersonating 
the website you are trying to talk to and from snooping
on your communication. It is not perfect, and there have been various
incidents where HTTPS failed because of forged or stolen certificates
and broken software, but it is a lot safer than plain HTTP.
