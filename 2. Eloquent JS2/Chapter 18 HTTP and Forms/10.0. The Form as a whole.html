<!--
When a field is contained in a <form> element, its DOM element will
have a form property linking back to the form’s DOM element. The
<form> element, in turn, has a property called elements that contains an
array-like collection of the fields inside it.
The name attribute of a form field determines the way its value will be
identified when the form is submitted. It can also be used as a property
name when accessing the form’s elements property, which acts both as
an array-like object (accessible by number) and a map (accessible by
name).
-->

<form action="example/submit.html">
    Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br>
    Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br>
    <button type="submit">Log in</button>
</form>
<script>
    let form = document.querySelector("form");
    console.log(form.elements[1].type);
    //->password
    console.log(form.elements.password.type);
    //->password
    cosnole.log(form.elements.name.form == form);
    //->true
</script>

<!--
A button with a type attribute of submit will, when pressed, cause
the form to be submitted. Pressing enter when a form field is focused
has the same effect.
Submitting a form normally means that the browser navigates to the
page indicated by the form’s action attribute, using either a GET or a
POST request. But before that happens, a "submit" event is fired. You
can handle this event with JavaScript and prevent this default behavior
by calling preventDefault on the event object.
