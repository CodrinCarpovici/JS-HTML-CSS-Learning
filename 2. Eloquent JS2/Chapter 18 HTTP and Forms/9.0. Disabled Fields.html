<!--
All form fields can be disabled through their disabled attribute. It is an
attribute that can be specified without value—the fact that it is present
at all disables the element.

<button>I'm all right</button>
<button disabled>I'm out</button>

<!--
When a program is in the process of handling an action caused by
some button or other control that might require communication with
the server and thus take a while, it can be a good idea to disable the
control until the action finishes. That way, when the user gets impatient
and clicks it again, they don’t accidentally repeat their action.
