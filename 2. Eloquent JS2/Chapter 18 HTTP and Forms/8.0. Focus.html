<!--
Unlike most elements in HTML documents, form fields can get keyboard
focus. When clicked or activated in some other way, they become the
currently active element and the recipient of keyboard input.
Thus, you can type into a text field only when it is focused. Other
fields respond differently to keyboard events. For example, a <select>
menu tries to move to the option that contains the text the user typed
and responds to the arrow keys by moving its selection up and down.
We can control focus from JavaScript with the focus and blur methods. 
The first moves focus to the DOM element it is called on, and the
second removes focus. The value in document.activeElement corresponds
to the currently focused element.
-->

<input type="text">
<script>
    document.querySelector("input").focus();
    console.log(document.activeElement.tagName);
    //->INPUT
    document.querySelector("input").blur();
    console.log(document.activeElement.tagName);
    //->BODY
</script>

<!--
For some pages, the user is expected to want to interact with a form
field immediately. JavaScript can be used to focus this field when the
document is loaded, but HTML also provides the autofocus attribute,
which produces the same effect while letting the browser know what we
are trying to achieve. This gives the browser the option to disable the
behavior when it is not appropriate, such as when the user has put the
focus on something else.
Browsers traditionally also allow the user to move the focus through
the document by pressing the tab key. We can influence the order in
which elements receive focus with the tabindex attribute. The following
example document will let the focus jump from the text input to the
OK button, rather than going through the help link first:
-->

<input type="text" tabindex=1> <a href=".">(help)</a>
<button onclick="console.log(`ok`)" tabindex=2>OK</button>

<!--
By default, most types of HTML elements cannot be focused. But
you can add a tabindex attribute to any element that will make it
focusable. A tabindex of -1 makes tabbing skip over an element, even
if it is normally focusable.
