<!--
Fields created by <textarea> tags, or <input> tags with a type of text or
password, share a common interface. Their DOM elements have a value
property that holds their current content as a string value. Setting this
property to another string changes the field’s content.
The selectionStart and selectionEnd properties of text fields give us
information about the cursor and selection in the text. When nothing
is selected, these two properties hold the same number, indicating the
position of the cursor. For example, 0 indicates the start of the text,
and 10 indicates the cursor is after the 10th character. When part of
the field is selected, the two properties will differ, giving us the start
and end of the selected text. Like value, these properties may also be
written to.
Imagine you are writing an article about Khasekhemwy but have
some trouble spelling his name. The following code wires up a <textarea
> tag with an event handler that, when you press F2, inserts the string
“Khasekhemwy” for you.
-->

<textarea></textarea>
<script>
    let textarea = document.querySelector("textarea");
    textarea.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
        //The key code for F2 happens to be 113
        if(event.keyCode == 113) {
            replaceSelection(textarea, "Khasekhemwy");
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });
    function replaceSelection(field, word) {
        let from = field.selectionStart, to = field.selectionEnd;
        field.value = field.value.slice(0, from) + word +
                      field.value.slice(to);
        //Put the cursor after the word
        field.selectionStart = from + word.length;
        field.selectionEnd = from + word.length;
    }
</script>

<!--
The replaceSelection function replaces the currently selected part of
a text field’s content with the given word and then moves the cursor
after that word so that the user can continue typing.
The "change" event for a text field does not fire every time something
is typed. Rather, it fires when the field loses focus after its content was
changed.
