Making HTTP requests in web page scripts once again raises concerns
about security. The person who controls the script might not have the
same interests as the person on whose computer it is running.
For this reason, browsers protect us by disallowing scripts to make
HTTP requests to other domains (names such as themafia.org and mybank.com).
This can be an annoying problem when building systems that want to
access several domains for legitimate reasons. Fortunately, servers can
include a header like this in their response to explicitly indicate to the
browser that it is okay for the request to come from another domain:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
