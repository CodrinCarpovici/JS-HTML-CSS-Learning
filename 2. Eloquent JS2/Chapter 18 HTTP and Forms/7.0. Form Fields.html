<!--
Forms were originally designed for the pre-JavaScript Web to allow web
sites to send user-submitted information in an HTTP request. This design 
assumes that interaction with the server always happens by navigating to a new page.
But their elements are part of the DOM like the rest of the page,
and the DOM elements that represent form fields support a number
of properties and events that are not present on other elements. These
make it possible to inspect and control such input fields with JavaScript
programs and do things such as adding new functionality to a form or
using forms and fields as building blocks in a JavaScript application.

A lot of field types use the <input> tag. This tag’s type attribute is
used to select the field’s style. These are some commonly used <input>
types:
text A single-line text field
password Same as text but hides the text that is typed
checkbox An on/off switch
radio (Part of) a multiple-choice field

<!--
Multiline text fields have their own tag, <textarea>, mostly because
using an attribute to specify a multiline starting value would be awkward. The <textarea> tag requires a matching </textarea> closing tag
and uses the text between those two, instead of the value attribute, as
starting text.
-->
    <textarea>
        one
        two
        three
    </textarea>

<!--
The <select> tag is used to create a field that allows the user
to select from a number of predefined options.
-->

    <select>
        <option>Pancakes</option>
        <option>Pudding</option>
        <option>Ice cream</option>
    </select>

<!--
Whenever the value of a form field changes, it will fire a "change"
event.
