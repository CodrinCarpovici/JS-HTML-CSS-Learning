<!--
What it does not have is a property that contains the content of the
file. Getting at that is a little more involved. Since reading a file from
disk can take time, the interface must be asynchronous to avoid freezing
the document.
-->

<input type="file" multiple>
<script>
    let input = document.querySelector("input");
    input.addEventListener("change", () => {
        for (let file of Array.from(input.files)) {
            let reader = new FileReader();
            reader.addEventListener("load", () => {
                console.log("File", file.name, "starts with",
                            reader.result.slice(0, 20));
            });
            reader.readAsText(file);
        }
    });
</script>

<!--
Reading a file is done by creating a FileReader object, registering a
"load" event handler for it, and calling its readAsText method, giving
it the file we want to read. Once loading finishes, the reader’s result
property contains the file’s content.
FileReaders also fire an "error" event when reading the file fails for
any reason. The error object itself will end up in the reader’s error
property. This interface was designed before promises became part of
the language. You could wrap it in a promise like this:
-->

<script>
    function readTextFile(file) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            let reader = new FileReader();
            reader.addEventListener(
                "load", () => resolve(reader.result));
            reader.addEventListener(
                "error", () => reject(reader.error));
            reader.readAsTextFile(file);
        });
    }
</script>
