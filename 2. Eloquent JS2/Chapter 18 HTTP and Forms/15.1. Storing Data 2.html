<!--
A value in localStorage sticks around until it is overwritten, it is
removed with removeItem, or the user clears their local data.
Sites from different domains get different storage compartments. That
means data stored in localStorage by a given website can, in principle,
be read (and overwritten) only by scripts on that same site.
Browsers do enforce a limit on the size of the data a site can store
in localStorage. That restriction, along with the fact that filling up
peopleâ€™s hard drives with junk is not really profitable, prevents the
feature from eating up too much space.
The following code implements a crude note-taking application. It
keeps a set of named notes and allows the user to edit notes and create
new ones.
-->

Notes: <select></select> <button>Add</button><br>
<textarea style="width: 100%"></textarea>

<script>
    let list = document.querySelector("select");
    let note = document.querySelector("textarea");

    let state;
    function setState(newState) {
        list.textContent = "";
        for (let name of Object.keys(newState.notes)) {
            let option = document.createElement("option");
            option.textContent = name;
            if (newState.selected == name) option.selected = true;
            list.appendChild(option);
        }
        note.value = newState.notes[newState.selected];

        localStorage.setItem("Notes", JSON.stringify(newState));
        state = newState;
    }
    setState(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("Notes")) || {
        notes: {"shopping list": "Carrots\nRaisins"},
        selected: "shopping list"
    });

    list.addEventListener("change", () => {
        setState({notes: state.notes, selected: list.value});
    });
    note.addEventListener("change", () => {
        setState({
            notes: Object.assign({}, state.notes,
                                 {[state.selected]: note.value}),
            selected: state.selected
        });
    });
    document.querySelector("button")
        .addEventListener("click", () => {
            let name = prompt("Note name");
            if (name) setState({
                notes: Object.assign({}, state.notes, {[name]: ""}),
                selected: name
            });
        });
</script>

<!--
The script gets its starting state from the "Notes" value stored in
localStorage or, if that is missing, creates an example state that has
only a shopping list in it. Reading a field that does not exist from
localStorage will yield null. Passing null to JSON.parse will make it
parse the string "null" and return null. Thus, the || operator can be
used to provide a default value in a situation like this.
The setState method makes sure the DOM is showing a given state
and stores the new state to localStorage. Event handlers call this function 
to move to a new state.
The use of Object.assign in the example is intended to create a new
object that is a clone of the old state.notes, but with one property
added or overwritten. Object.assign takes its first argument and adds
all properties from any further arguments to it. Thus, giving it an
empty object will cause it to fill a fresh object. The square brackets
notation in the third argument is used to create a property whose name
is based on some dynamic value.
There is another object, similar to localStorage, called sessionStorage
. The difference between the two is that the content of sessionStorage
is forgotten at the end of each session, which for most browsers means
whenever the browser is closed.
