<!--
The files property of a file field element is an array-like object (again,
not a real array) containing the files chosen in the field. It is initially
empty. The reason there isn’t simply a file property is that file fields
also support a multiple attribute, which makes it possible to select
multiple files at the same time.
Objects in the files object have properties such as name (the filename), 
size (the file’s size in bytes, which are chunks of 8 bits), and
type (the media type of the file, such as text/plain or image/jpeg).
