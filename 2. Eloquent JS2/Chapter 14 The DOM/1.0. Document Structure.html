<!--
You can imagine an HTML document as a nested set of boxes. Tags
such as <body> and </body> enclose other tags, which in turn contain
other tags or text. Hereâ€™s the example document from the previous
chapter:
-->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My home page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My home page</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.</p>
<p>I also wrote a book! Read it
<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--
The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows 
this shape. For each box, there is an object, which we can interact
with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which
boxes and text it contains. This representation is called the Document
Object Model, or DOM for short.
The global binding document gives us access to these objects. Its
documentElement property refers to the object representing the <html>
tag. Since every HTML document has a head and a body, it also has
head and body properties, pointing at those elements.
