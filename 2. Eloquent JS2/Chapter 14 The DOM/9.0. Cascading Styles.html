<!--
The styling system for HTML is called CSS, for Cascading Style Sheets.
A style sheet is a set of rules for how to style elements in a document.
It can be given inside a <style> tag.

<style>
    strong {
        font-style: italic;
        color: gray;
    }
</style>
<p>Now <strong>strong text</strong> is italic and gray.</p>
