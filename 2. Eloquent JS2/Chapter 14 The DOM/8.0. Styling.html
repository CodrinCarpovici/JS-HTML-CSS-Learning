<!--
We have seen that different HTML elements are drawn differently.
Some are displayed as blocks, others inline. Some add styling—<strong>
makes its content bold, and <a> makes it blue and underlines it.
The way an <img> tag shows an image or an <a> tag causes a link to
be followed when it is clicked is strongly tied to the element type. But
we can change the styling associated with an element, such as the text
color or underline. Here is an example that uses the style property:
-->

<p><a href=".">Normal link</a></p>
<p><a href="." style="color: green">Green link</a></p>

This text is displayed <strong>inline</strong>,
<strong style="display: block">as a block</strong>, and
<strong style="display: none">not at all</strong>.

<!--
The block tag will end up on its own line since block elements are
not displayed inline with the text around them. The last tag is not
displayed at all—display: none prevents an element from showing up
on the screen. This is a way to hide elements. It is often preferable to
removing them from the document entirely because it makes it easy to
reveal them again later.
-->

<p id="para" style="color: purple">
    Nice text
</p>

<script>
    let para = document.getElementById("para");
    console.log(para.style.color);
    para.style.color = "magenta";
</script>

<!--
Some style property names contain hyphens, such as font-family.
Because such property names are awkward to work with in JavaScript
(you’d have to say style["font-family"]), the property names in the
style object for such properties have their hyphens removed and the
letters after them capitalized (style.fontFamily).
