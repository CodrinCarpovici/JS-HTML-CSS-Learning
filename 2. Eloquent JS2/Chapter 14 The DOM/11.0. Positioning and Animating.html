<!--
The position style property influences layout in a powerful way. By
default it has a value of static, meaning the element sits in its normal
place in the document. When it is set to relative, the element still takes
up space in the document, but now the top and left style properties
can be used to move it relative to that normal place. When position
is set to absolute, the element is removed from the normal document
flow—that is, it no longer takes up space and may overlap with other
elements. Also, its top and left properties can be used to absolutely
position it relative to the top-left corner of the nearest enclosing element
whose position property isn’t static, or relative to the document if no
such enclosing element exists.
We can use this to create an animation. The following document
displays a picture of a cat that moves around in an ellipse:
-->

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="cat.jpg" style="position: relative">
</p>
<script>
    let cat = document.querySelector("img");
    let angle = Math.PI / 2;
    function animate(time, lastTime) {
        if (lastTime != null) {
            angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
        }
        cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px";
        cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";
        requestAnimationFrame(newTime => animate(newTime, time));
    }
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
</script>

<!--
Our picture is centered on the page and given a position of relative.
We’ll repeatedly update that picture’s top and left styles to move it.
The script uses requestAnimationFrame to schedule the animate function 
to run whenever the browser is ready to repaint the screen. The
animate function itself again calls requestAnimationFrame to schedule the
next update. When the browser window (or tab) is active, this will
cause updates to happen at a rate of about 60 per second, which tends
to produce a good-looking animation.

If we just updated the DOM in a loop, the page would freeze, and
nothing would show up on the screen. Browsers do not update their
display while a JavaScript program is running, nor do they allow any
interaction with the page. This is why we need requestAnimationFrame
—it lets the browser know that we are done for now, and it can go
ahead and do the things that browsers do, such as updating the screen
and responding to user actions.
