<!--
Almost everything about the DOM data structure can be changed. The
shape of the document tree can be modified by changing parent-child
relationships. Nodes have a remove method to remove them from their
current parent node. To add a child node to an element node, we can
use appendChild, which puts it at the end of the list of children, or
insertBefore, which inserts the node given as the first argument before
the node given as the second argument.

<p>One</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Three</p>
<script>
    let paragraphs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
    document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]);
</script>

<!--
A node can exist in the document in only one place. Thus, inserting
paragraph Three in front of paragraph One will first remove it from
the end of the document and then insert it at the front, resulting in
Three/One/Two. All operations that insert a node somewhere will, as
a side effect, cause it to be removed from its current position (if it has
one).
The replaceChild method is used to replace a child node with another
one. It takes as arguments two nodes: a new node and the node to be
replaced. The replaced node must be a child of the element the method
is called on. Note that both replaceChild and insertBefore expect the
new node as their first argument.
