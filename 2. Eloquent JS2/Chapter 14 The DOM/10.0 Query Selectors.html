<!--
The main reason I introduced selector syntax—the notation used in
style sheets to determine which elements a set of styles apply to—is
that we can use this same mini-language as an effective way to find
DOM elements.
The querySelectorAll method, which is defined both on the document
object and on element nodes, takes a selector string and returns a
NodeList containing all the elements that it matches.

    <span class="animal">rabbits</span>
</p>
<p>And you know you're going to fall</p>
<p>Tell 'em a <span class="character">hookah smoking
        <span class="animal">caterpillar</span></span></p>
<p>Has given you the call</p>

<script>
    function count(selector) {
        return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
    }
    console.log(count("p")); // All <p> elements
    // → 4
    console.log(count(".animal")); // Class animal
    // → 2
    console.log(count("p .animal")); // Animal inside of <p>
    // → 2
    console.log(count("p > .animal")); // Direct child of <p>
    // → 1
</script>

Unlike methods such as getElementsByTagName, the object returned
by querySelectorAll is not live. It won’t change when you change the
document. It is still not a real array, though, so you still need to call
Array.from if you want to treat it like one.
The querySelector method (without the All part) works in a similar
way. This one is useful if you want a specific, single element. It will
return only the first matching element or null when no element matches.
