<!--
A program that repeatedly alternates between reading DOM layout
information and changing the DOM forces a lot of layout computations
to happen and will consequently run very slowly. The following code is
an example of this. It contains two different programs that build up a
line of X characters 2,000 pixels wide and measures the time each one
takes
-->

<p><span id="one"></span></p>
<p><span id="two"></span></p>
<script>
    function time(name, action) {
        let start = Date.now(); // Current time in milliseconds
        action();
        console.log(name, "took", Date.now() - start, "ms");
    }
    time("naive", () => {
        let target = document.getElementById("one");
        while (target.offsetWidth < 2000) {
            target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
        }
    });
    // → naive took 32 ms
    time("clever", function () {
        let target = document.getElementById("two");
        target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));
        let total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));
        target.firstChild.nodeValue = "X".repeat(total);
    });
    // → clever took 1 ms
</script>
