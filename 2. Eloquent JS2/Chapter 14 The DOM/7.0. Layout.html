<!--
You may have noticed that different types of elements are laid out
differently. Some, such as paragraphs (<p>) or headings (<h1>), take up
the whole width of the document and are rendered on separate lines.
These are called block elements. Others, such as links (<a>) or the <
strong> element, are rendered on the same line with their surrounding
text. Such elements are called inline elements.
The size and position of an element can be accessed from JavaScript.
The offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties give you the space the
element takes up in pixels. A pixel is the basic unit of measurement in
the browser. It traditionally corresponds to the smallest dot that the
screen can draw, but on modern displays, which can draw very small
dots, that may no longer be the case, and a browser pixel may span
multiple display dots.
Similarly, clientWidth and clientHeight give you the size of the space
inside the element, ignoring border width.
