<!--
Say we want to write a script that replaces all images (<img> tags) in
the document with the text held in their alt attributes, which specifies
an alternative textual representation of the image.
This involves not only removing the images but adding a new text
node to replace them. Text nodes are created with the document.
createTextNode method.

<p> The <img src="cat.jpg" alt="Cat"> in the 
    <img src="hat.jpg" alt="Hat">.</p>

<p><button onclick="replaceImages()">Replace</button></p>

<script>
    function replaceImages() {
        let images = document.body.getElementsByTagName('img');
        for(let i = images.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            let image = images[i];
            if (image.alt) {
                let text = document.createTextNode(image.alt);
                image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);
            }
        }
    }
</script>

<!--
Given a string, createTextNode gives us a text node that we can insert
into the document to make it show up on the screen.
The loop that goes over the images starts at the end of the list.
This is necessary because the node list returned by a method like
getElementsByTagName (or a property like childNodes) is live. That is,
it is updated as the document changes. If we started from the front,
removing the first image would cause the list to lose its first element
so that the second time the loop repeats, where i is 1, it would stop
because the length of the collection is now also 1.
