<!--
The cascading in the name refers to the fact that multiple such rules
are combined to produce the final style for an element. In the example,
the default styling for <strong> tags, which gives them font-weight:
bold, is overlaid by the rule in the <style> tag, which adds font-style
and color.
When multiple rules define a value for the same property, the most
recently read rule gets a higher precedence and wins. So if the rule in
the <style> tag included font-weight: normal, contradicting the default
font-weight rule, the text would be normal, not bold. Styles in a style
attribute applied directly to the node have the highest precedence and
always win.
It is possible to target things other than tag names in CSS rules. A
rule for .abc applies to all elements with "abc" in their class attribute.
A rule for #xyz applies to the element with an id attribute of "xyz"
(which should be unique within the document).

<style>
    .subtle {
        color: gray;
        font-size: 80%;
    }
    #header {
        background: blue;
        color: white;
    }
    /*p elements with id main and with classes a and b*/
    p#main.a.b {
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }

</style>

<!--
The precedence rule favoring the most recently defined rule applies
only when the rules have the same specificity. A rule’s specificity is a
measure of how precisely it describes matching elements, determined by
the number and kind (tag, class, or ID) of element aspects it requires.
For example, a rule that targets p.a is more specific than rules that
target p or just .a and would thus take precedence over them.
The notation p > a …{} applies the given styles to all <a> tags that
are direct children of <p> tags. Similarly, p a …{} applies to all <a> tags
inside <p> tags, whether they are direct or indirect children.
