<!--
All element nodes have a getElementsByTagName method, which collects 
all elements with the given tag name that are descendants (direct
or indirect children) of that node and returns them as an array-like
object.
To find a specific single node, you can give it an id attribute and use
document.getElementById instead.
-->

<p>My ostrich Gertrude:</p>
<p><img id="gertrude" src="ostrich.png"></p>

<script>
    let ostrich = document.getElementById("gertrude");
    console.log(ostrich.src);
</script>

<!--
A third, similar method is getElementsByClassName, which, like 
getElementsByTagName, searches through the contents of an element node 
and retrieves all elements that have the given string in their class 
attribute.
