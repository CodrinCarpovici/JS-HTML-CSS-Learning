When we defined if and while, you probably noticed that they were
more or less trivial wrappers around JavaScript’s own if and while.
Similarly, the values in Egg are just regular old JavaScript values.
If you compare the implementation of Egg, built on top of JavaScript,
with the amount of work and complexity required to build a programming language directly on the raw functionality provided by a machine,
the difference is huge. Regardless, this example ideally gave you an impression of the way programming languages work.
And when it comes to getting something done, cheating is more effective than doing everything yourself. Though the toy language in this
chapter doesn’t do anything that couldn’t be done better in JavaScript,
there are situations where writing small languages helps get real work
done.
Such a language does not have to resemble a typical programming
language. If JavaScript didn’t come equipped with regular expressions,
for example, you could write your own parser and evaluator for regular
expressions.

Or imagine you are building a giant robotic dinosaur and need to
program its behavior. JavaScript might not be the most effective way
to do this. You might instead opt for a language that looks like this:

behavior walk
perform when
destination ahead
actions
move left-foot
move right-foot

behavior attack
perform when
Godzilla in-view
actions
fire laser-eyes
launch arm-rockets

This is what is usually called a domain-specific language, a language
tailored to express a narrow domain of knowledge. Such a language
can be more expressive than a general-purpose language because it is
designed to describe exactly the things that need to be described in its
domain, and nothing else.
