The Game:
-based on Dark Blue (www.lessmilk.com/games/10)
-minimalist
-platform game
-the player(dark box) has the task of collecting the yellow boxes (coins) 
 while avoiding the red stuff (lava)
-A level is completed when all the coins have been collected
-The player can walk around with the left and right arrow keys and can
 jump with the up arrow
-The game consists of a static background, laid out like a grid, with
 the moving elements overlaid on that background. Each field on the
 grid is either empty, solid, or lava
- The moving elements are the player, coins, and certain pieces of lava. 
 The positions of these elements are not constrained to the gridâ€”their 
 coordinates may be fractional, allowing smooth motion

The Technology:
-the browser DOM to display the game
-reading user input by handling key events
-creating DOM elements and use styling to give them a background, size 
 and position
-the background can be represented as a table
-the free moving elements can be overlaid using absolutely positioned 
 elements
