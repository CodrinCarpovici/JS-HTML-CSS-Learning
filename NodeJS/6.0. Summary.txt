Node is a nice, small system that lets us run JavaScript in a nonbrowser
context. It was originally designed for network tasks to play the role of
a node in a network. But it lends itself to all kinds of scripting tasks,
and if writing JavaScript is something you enjoy, automating tasks with
Node works well.
NPM provides packages for everything you can think of (and quite
a few things youâ€™d probably never think of), and it allows you to fetch
and install those packages with the npm program. Node comes with a
number of built-in modules, including the fs module for working with
the file system and the http module for running HTTP servers and
making HTTP requests.
All input and output in Node is done asynchronously, unless you 
explicitly use a synchronous variant of a function, such as readFileSync.
When calling such asynchronous functions, you provide callback functions, 
and Node will call them with an error value and (if available) a
result when it is ready.
