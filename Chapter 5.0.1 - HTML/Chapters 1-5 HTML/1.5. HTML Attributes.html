<!--
1. Absolute URL - 
Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get 
permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. 
In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be 
removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - 
Links to an image that is hosted within the website. 
Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without 
a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, 
it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. 
They will not break if you change domain.
