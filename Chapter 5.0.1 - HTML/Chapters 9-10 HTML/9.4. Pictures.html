    <!--The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility 
        in specifying image resources.
        The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, 
        each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. 
        This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the 
        current view and/or device.
        Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when 
        the image is the most suitable.
    -->
    <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img/ostrich.png">
        <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img/programming.gif">
        <img src="img/workplace.jpg">
    </picture>

<!--
There is 2 main reasons to use the picture element:
1.Bandwidth:
If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large 
image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching 
attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
2.Format Support:
Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the 
<picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will 
use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following 
elements.
